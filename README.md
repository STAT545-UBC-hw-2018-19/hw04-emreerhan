# Homework04: Tidy data and joins

This is my repository for homework04 for STAT545 at UBC. In this assignment, I explored using the methods we learned in class for tidying data, and joining `data.frames` SQL style. You can see my work in the links below.

* [Github document](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-emreerhan/blob/master/hw04-tidy-joins.md)
* [Rmarkdown document](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-emreerhan/blob/master/hw04-tidy-joins.Rmd)

I recommend you view the Github document if you would like to see all the graphs I produced.
